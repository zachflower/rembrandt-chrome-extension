Finding a usable brand name for your startup or project can be stressful and time consuming.

Rembrandt cuts down some of that time by automatically checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest for brand username availability whenever you search for a new domain name on name.com.

Keep in mind this is more of a rough draft than a fully-fledged extension. Some things may break, but that's okay! Just let me know and I'll do my best to fix it!
